                    <h5>Software Engineer III <span> - USAA</span></h5>
                    <p>
                        As a Software Engineer III in USAA's Platform Infrastructure department, 
                        I am responsible for managing and maintaining USAA's GitLab instance and 
                        supporting the continuous improvement of its infrastructure. My team 
                        oversees <strong>GitLab</strong>, <strong>GitLab CI</strong>, and other 
                        internal projects, ensuring smooth integration and optimized workflows 
                        for developers across the organization. 
                        In my role, I have contributed significantly to leading pipeline releases, 
                        streamlining and improving pipeline templates for users, and enhancing 
                        GitLab infrastructure to support scalable development processes. I 
                        collaborate with cross-functional teams to identify and address system 
                        performance issues, implement security measures, and ensure the stability 
                        and reliability of our platform. My work directly impacts the efficiency 
                        of our internal development operations and enhances the developer 
                        experience for all users.
                        Through this work, I've gained valuable experience in large-scale 
                        infrastructure management, deepened my knowledge of continuous integration 
                        and deployment (CI/CD) processes, and developed strong problem-solving and 
                        collaboration skills.

                    <h5>Software Engineer Intern <span> - LegalZoom</span></h5>
                    <p>
                        As a software engineering intern with LegalZoom, I had the opportunity to 
                        contribute to the Process & Validation team, where I created a user 
                        interface for the management of robotic process automation (RPA). Engaging 
                        in frequent team meetings, I played a pivotal role in discussions surrounding 
                        LegalZoom's <strong>REST API management</strong> and the implementation of 
                        best design practices. During this transformative experience, I built a 
                        powerful internal tool using <strong>Retool and JavaScript</strong>, 
                        allowing employees to efficiently manage RPA triggers.
                        <br> My responsibilities extended to compiling and rigorously testing API 
                        calls using <strong>Swagger and Postman</strong>, ensuring seamless 
                        integration. To facilitate knowledge transfer and adoption within the team, 
                        I meticulously documented the tool's functionality, architecture, and usage 
                        instructions. This end-to-end project engagement—from planning and 
                        implementation to deployment—provided me with invaluable insights into the 
                        comprehensive lifecycle of software engineering projects.

                    <p>
                        As a software engineering intern at BNY Mellon on the Risk Technology team, 
                        I played a pivotal role in creating technology to assess the risk of 
                        hypothetical investments. Employing Agile methodologies, I focused on 
                        developing a robust data service using <strong>Java Spring Boot</strong>.
                        This service seamlessly connected the backend to the frontend, delivering 
                        aggregate trade data from the <strong>Hadoop Distributed File System</strong>. <br>
                        In ensuring optimal integration, I verified UI endpoints using <strong>SQL, 
                        Java 17, and Swagger</strong>, achieving a commendable <strong>97%</strong>
                        coverage through meticulous unit testing using <strong>JUnit</strong>. This 
                        hands-on experience in middleware not only honed my Java skills but also 
                        provided valuable insights into the entire tech stack, encompassing 
                        <strong>Python</strong> in the backend and <strong>AngularJS</strong> in 
                        the frontend.

                        As a dedicated Teaching Assistant at the University of Florida, I played a 
                        crucial role in guiding students through the intricacies of Programming 
                        Fundamentals 2 for multiple semesters. This expansive class, accommodating 
                        over <strong>500 students</strong> each semester, centered on the teachings 
                        of <strong>C++</strong>, exploring fundamental concepts like pointers, memory 
                        allocation, and basic data structures. <br>
                        My role involved a diverse set of responsibilities. This included conducting
                        regular office hours to assist enrolled students with concepts, labs, 
                        projects, or exams. I also led personalized lab sections for two groups, 
                        each with <strong>20+ students</strong>, creating an interactive environment 
                        to explore class concepts and address questions. Furthermore, I took charge

                            Swamp Sounds is a group-based playlist app built with Python, Flask, and 
                            JavaScript using the Spotify API. Think group chats, but for music — everyone 
                            can toss songs into a shared playlist pool that reflects the vibe of your crew.

                            I used Python to dive into tasks like sequence labeling, document similarity, 
                            and semantic role labeling across English and French. It challenged me to think 
                            critically about how the nuances of human communication translate into data.

                            Volleyball is a newer adventure for me, and I'm hooked! I play in a rec league 
                            where being short definitely keeps things interesting, but it's all part of the 
                            fun. I didn't expect it to be so team-focused, and it's been awesome to grow my 
                            skills (still working hard on that overhand serve!).

                            Pottery is such a rewarding (and humbling) hobby. It's so much harder than it 
                            looks, but there's nothing quite like seeing a lump of clay turn into something 
                            real and beautiful. Plus, a little mess just makes the creative process more fun.
